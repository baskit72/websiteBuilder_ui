Subject: Request for Reinstatement of Transport Services

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I am writing to request the reinstatement of my transport services, which were recently suspended due to three missed pickups within a week. I understand the importance of adhering to the roster and appreciate the need to notify the transport team in a timely manner. However, I would like to provide context for the missed pickups and seek your approval for reinstatement.

One of the missed pickups was scheduled for Saturday. As my work schedule is typically five days per week, I was not expecting transport on a non-working day and had not planned accordingly. I understand now that I should have confirmed this with the transport team, and I apologize for the oversight.

Moving forward, I will ensure that I check my transport schedule carefully and will reach out in advance if there are any changes to avoid future occurrences. I kindly request your approval for reinstatement, as I am committed to preventing this issue from recurring.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I am reaching out to request the reinstatement of my transport services, which were recently suspended due to three missed pickups in a week. I understand the importance of notifying the transport team in advance and apologize for any inconvenience caused. However, I would like to provide some context regarding these missed pickups.

On one of the days, I was unwell and unable to attend work, which led to my missing the scheduled pickup. Additionally, one of the other missed pickups was on a Saturday, which is not a regular workday for me. I had not anticipated transport on a non-working day and apologize for not canceling it in advance.

Going forward, I will ensure I review the roster thoroughly and confirm or cancel transport bookings as needed. I kindly request your approval for the reinstatement of my transport services, as I am committed to avoiding such oversights in the future.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
